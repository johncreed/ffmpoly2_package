\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a model-based feature conjunction framework. Under this general framework, an adaptive model based on feature-pair frequency is used to improve the CTR prediction in recommender systems. The main idea is to apply the most suitable model for each pair of feature conjunction. While the concept is extremely simple, the selection of models depends on some hyperparameters. We demonstrate that with a proper design of the parameter-selection procedure, a right selection or combination of models can be achieved for CTR prediction problems. We conducted extensive experiments on two sets from Kaggle competitions and a Company data set from our production system to compare our model and the state-of-the-art models. The experimental results suggest our model is effective in predicting CTR.

Although the proposed method proves the success of model-based feature conjunction, there are still some interesting works for further studies. As to the framework, one future direction is to explore the combination of more models for CTR prediction. Another direction is to check different ways of feature conjunction. Besides, we will conduct further online experiments to evaluate effectiveness of our model.
